# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset to explore pricing patterns, room types, and geographic distribution of listings across the five boroughs. The goal is to apply exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from a large real-world dataset.

## Dataset

* Source: Kaggle – NYC Airbnb Open Data
* Size: ~49,000 listings
* Features include location, price, room type, availability, and review activity

## Objectives

* Understand how Airbnb listings are distributed across NYC boroughs
* Analyze price distribution and identify outliers
* Compare pricing across different room types
* Explore geographic clustering of listings

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Methodology

* Loaded and cleaned raw data
* Handled missing values and formatted features
* Performed exploratory data analysis using summary statistics
* Built visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts

## Key Insights

* Manhattan and Brooklyn contain the highest number of listings
* Listing prices are right-skewed with a small number of high-priced outliers
* Entire homes and apartments are generally more expensive than private or shared rooms
* Location and room type strongly influence pricing

## Outcome

This project demonstrates practical data analysis and visualization skills using Python and highlights how exploratory analysis can support understanding of urban market behavior.
